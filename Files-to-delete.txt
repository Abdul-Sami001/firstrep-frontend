Files to delete
1. Example components (entire folder unused)
components/examples/Cart.tsx
components/examples/CategoryCard.tsx
components/examples/Header.tsx
components/examples/Hero.tsx
components/examples/ProductCard.tsx
components/examples/ThemeProvider.tsx
2. Unused component files
components/OrderStatus.tsx (not imported anywhere)
components/PaymentStatus.tsx (not imported anywhere)
components/GenderSelector.tsx (not imported in app files)
components/ui/responsive-image.tsx (not imported anywhere)
3. Unused hooks
hooks/useCarts.ts (duplicate of useCart.ts, never imported)
4. Unused pages/routes
app/(site)/home/page.tsx (just returns null, unused)
app/reseller/login/ (empty directory)
5. Non-code files
lib.rar (archive file, not needed in codebase)
Cursor-prompt-frontend.txt (documentation/notes file)
6. Potentially unused (verify before deleting)
contexts/ThemeProvider.tsx — There are two ThemeProviders:
components/ThemeProvider.tsx (used in app/layout.tsx)
contexts/ThemeProvider.tsx (different implementation, verify if used)
Check if contexts/ThemeProvider.tsx is imported anywhere. If not, it can be deleted.
7. UI components (shadcn components — keep if part of your UI library)
components/ui/chart.tsx (not imported, but might be a shadcn component)
components/ui/input-otp.tsx (not imported, but might be a shadcn component)
Note: The useCart hook in hooks/useCart.ts references clearCart and applyCoupon methods that don't exist in lib/api/cart/index.ts. These methods won't work, but the file itself is used, so keep it and fix the implementation separately.
Summary: Safe to delete: 13 files + 1 empty directory. Verify before deleting: 1 file (contexts/ThemeProvider.tsx).
