## Customer Registration & Welcome Series

### What Happens When a Customer Registers?

**Step 1: Customer Signs Up**
- A new customer creates an account on your website
- Their information is automatically saved in the system

**Step 2: Automatic Welcome**
- The system immediately sends a welcome email
- The customer is automatically added to your email list
- They're subscribed to receive marketing emails (they can unsubscribe anytime)

**Step 3: Welcome Email Series**
- **Email 1** (Immediate): "Welcome to 1stRep!" - Introduces your brand
- **Email 2** (24 hours later): "Products You'll Love" - Shows product recommendations
- **Email 3** (3 days later): "Special Offer" - Provides a discount code for first purchase

**Why This Matters:**
- Makes new customers feel valued
- Introduces your brand and products
- Encourages first purchase with special offers
- Builds relationship from day one

## Email Campaigns

### How Email Campaigns Work

**What is an Email Campaign?**
An email campaign is when you send a marketing email to a group of customers at once.

**The Process:**

1. **Create a Segment** (Who to send to)
   - Choose which customers to target
   - Examples: "All Customers", "VIP Customers", "New Customers"
   - Can be based on purchase history, spending, or other criteria

2. **Create or Choose a Template** (What to send)
   - Design your email with images, text, and links
   - Personalize with customer's name
   - Include special offers or announcements

3. **Schedule or Send**
   - Send immediately or schedule for later
   - System sends emails automatically
   - Tracks who opened and clicked

**Example Campaigns:**
- **Sale Announcement**: "50% Off Everything - This Weekend Only!"
- **New Product Launch**: "Check Out Our New Tactical Gear"
- **Seasonal Promotions**: "Black Friday Deals - Don't Miss Out!"

**Why This Matters:**
- Reach many customers at once
- Promote sales and new products
- Drive traffic to your website
- Increase sales with targeted offers

## Customer Segmentation

### What is Segmentation?

Segmentation means grouping customers based on their behavior, spending, or characteristics.

### Types of Segments

**1. Static Segments** (Manual Lists)
- You manually add customers to a list
- Example: "VIP Customers" - You select specific customers
- Good for: Small, specific groups

**2. Dynamic Segments** (Auto-Updating)
- System automatically finds customers matching criteria
- Updates automatically as customers change
- Examples:
  - "All Customers" - Everyone who has made a purchase
  - "VIP Customers" - Customers who spent over £500
  - "New Customers" - Customers who registered in last 30 days
  - "Inactive Customers" - Customers who haven't purchased in 90 days

**Why This Matters:**
- Send relevant emails to the right people
- VIP customers get exclusive offers
- Inactive customers get re-engagement campaigns
- New customers get welcome offers
- Increases email open rates and sales

## Loyalty Points Program

### How Loyalty Points Work

**Earning Points:**
1. Customer makes a purchase
2. System automatically calculates points (e.g., 1 point per £1 spent)
3. Points are added to customer's account
4. Customer receives email notification

**Example:**
- Customer spends £100
- Earns 100 points
- Points appear in their account immediately

**Redeeming Points:**
1. Customer accumulates points over time
2. At checkout, customer can choose to use points
3. Points convert to discount (e.g., 100 points = £1 off)
4. Points are deducted from account
5. Discount is applied to order

**Example:**
- Customer has 500 points
- Uses 500 points at checkout
- Gets £5 discount on their order
- Remaining balance: 0 points

**Why This Matters:**
- Rewards repeat customers
- Encourages customers to shop more
- Builds customer loyalty
- Increases customer lifetime value

---

## Referral Program

### How Referrals Work

**Step 1: Customer Gets Referral Code**
- Customer requests a referral code
- System generates unique code (e.g., "JOHN2024")
- Customer receives code via email or account page

**Step 2: Customer Shares Code**
- Customer shares code with friends/family
- Can share via email, social media, or word of mouth

**Step 3: Friend Uses Code**
- Friend visits website
- Enters referral code at checkout
- Makes purchase (minimum amount required, e.g., £50)

**Step 4: Rewards Issued**
- **Referrer** (original customer) gets reward (e.g., 10% discount)
- **Referee** (friend) gets reward (e.g., 5% discount)
- Both receive email confirmation

**Example:**
- John refers Sarah
- Sarah uses code "JOHN2024" and spends £100
- John gets 10% off next purchase (£10 value)
- Sarah gets 5% off her purchase (£5 off)

**Why This Matters:**
- Brings in new customers
- Rewards existing customers for referrals
- Word-of-mouth marketing
- Low-cost customer acquisition

## Gift Cards

### How Gift Cards Work

**Purchasing a Gift Card:**
1. Customer buys gift card (e.g., £50)
2. System generates unique code (e.g., "GIFT-ABC123XYZ")
3. Gift card sent to recipient via email
4. Can include personal message

**Redeeming a Gift Card:**
1. Recipient receives email with gift card code
2. At checkout, enters gift card code
3. System applies gift card amount to order
4. If order is less than gift card, remaining balance saved
5. If order is more than gift card, customer pays difference

**Example:**
- Sarah buys £50 gift card for John
- John receives email with code "GIFT-ABC123XYZ"
- John shops and orders £75 worth of products
- Gift card covers £50
- John pays remaining £25

**Why This Matters:**
- Increases sales (gift card purchases)
- Brings in new customers (gift card recipients)
- Perfect for holidays and special occasions
- Customers often spend more than gift card value

## Abandoned Cart Recovery

### What is an Abandoned Cart?

When a customer adds items to their shopping cart but doesn't complete the purchase.

### How Recovery Works

**Step 1: Cart Abandoned**
- Customer adds items to cart
- Leaves website without purchasing
- System detects abandoned cart

**Step 2: Recovery Emails Sent**
- **Email 1** (2 hours later): "You left items in your cart!" - Reminder
- **Email 2** (24 hours later): "10% Off Your Cart!" - Special discount
- **Email 3** (3 days later): "Last Chance!" - Final reminder

**Step 3: Customer Returns**
- Customer clicks link in email
- Returns to cart
- Completes purchase (often with discount)

**Why This Matters:**
- Recovers lost sales
- Many customers just need a reminder
- Discounts encourage completion
- Can recover 10-30% of abandoned carts
